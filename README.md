BG3 Painter DDS Exporter
</h1>


A Substance Painter DDS export plugin to automate the TGA to DDS conversion.

Mainly made for making Starfield modding easier via DDS creation, but could be tweaked in the future to be more modular and dependant on export presets.
No more spending 20 minutes manually converting those 20 different maps to DDS via tedious steps in PS/Intel/Paint.net etc

# Installation:
Extract the starfield-dds-exporter.py into your Substance Painter Plugin folder:
<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\python\plugins
</pre>

(Can also be found using the Python > Plugins Folder button in the top row)

## Export preset:
Move the Starfield.spexp from the optional files to this folder: 
<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\assets\export-presets
</pre>

## Enable the BG3-DDS-Exporter under the Python menu
First time running the plugin it will ask you what folder the Texconv.exe is located in via a UI pop-up. This will create a Starfield-DDS-Exporter-PluginSettings.ini in the plugin folder with the settings saved.
